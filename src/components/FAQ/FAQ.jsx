            How do wind turbines and solar panels work together in a renewable
            energy system?
          </h4>

          <div>
            Wind turbines and solar panels generate electricity through
            different mechanisms. Wind turbines harness the kinetic energy of
            the wind to turn blades, which then drive a generator. Solar panels
            convert sunlight into electricity through the photovoltaic effect.
            When integrated into a renewable energy system, these technologies
            complement each other by providing a continuous and reliable power
            supply. Wind power is often more abundant during certain times,
            while solar power is consistent during daylight hours, resulting in
            a more stable overall energy output.
